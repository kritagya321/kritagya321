## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in **mathematics**, **backend systems**, and **cloud computing**. I've contributed to building **highly scalable data pipelines**, **real-time streaming systems**, and **cloud-native applications** that handle high-volume message processing.

My expertise spans across:
- **Cloud-native architecture** (Azure, AWS)
- **Real-time data processing** and streaming systems
- **Backend development** with focus on performance & scalability
- **AI/ML** systems and data analytics

I thrive in teams where engineering excellence, security, and system reliability are paramount, and where mentorship, curiosity, and thoughtful collaboration drive innovation.
